Apart from all the repos you see on my profile here, I also built several other things:
 - https://www.authier.pm/ - my very own password manager with e2e encryption
 - https://callnotes.fyi/ - a simple speech to text transcription SaaS with few extra features 
 - https://github.com/alexisvincent/systemjs-hot-reloader (I built the initial version and transferred to current maintainer)


## How do I like to work?

I am always trying to work accordig to this approach when it comes to building software:

 - in a [Markdown format](https://github.com/0atman/noboilerplate/blob/main/scripts/34-Plain-Text-Team.md).
